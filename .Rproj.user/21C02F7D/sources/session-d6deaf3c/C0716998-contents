\title{Structure improvement evaluation for continuous Y.}
\usage{
ps_continuous(X, Y, Y2, cores = 1, BootNumber = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The predictors in the training set, which is an n times p dimensional matrix.}

\item{Y}{The true response in the training set, which is an n-dimensional vector.}

\item{Y2}{The prediction results of the trained model on the training set X.}

\item{cores}{The number of threads used for parallel computing. It can only be 1 in Windows environment}

\item{BootNumber}{The number of bootstrap steps in the calculation of p_s.}
}
\value{
The structure improvement index p_s. If p_s < 0.05, the model fit is not good enough and we need to increase the complexity of the model.
}
\description{
Compute the structure improvement index p_s for a continuous response Y.
}
\examples{
X <- matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10)
    Y <- X \%*\% rnorm(10, 5, 1) + rnorm(10)
    model <- lm(Y ~ X - 1)
    Y2 <- predict(model, newdata = data.frame(X))
    Y2 <- as.matrix(Y2, ncol = 1)
    ps_continuous(X, Y, Y2, 1, 100)
